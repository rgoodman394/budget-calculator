# Budget Calculator App
## *Rebekah Goodman | 03/22*


Thank you for visiting my project for the Code Louisville Javascript course Spring '22.

Here are the elements I picked to build my site:

1. Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value --> Used calculateBalance to subtract the income and the outcome and produce the total balance remaining.
2. Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application --> Generated a list of "entries" and display in the dashboard
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data --> Create a pie chart that shows the balance of the income - outcome.


Thanks again for checking out my project!
